INPLUGS-CO2 is an independent initiative started from EPFL researchers and aims to share
unbiased information about the technology of geological CO2 storage. Due to the human-induced
climate change, reduction of carbon emissions is becoming an increasingly urgent topic and CCS
technologies (of which GCS is part) can have a meaningful impact towards it.
Our efforts aim to provide a solid basis on how GCS works so that the reader can shape an
objective opinion about it.
In other words, the mission of INPLUGS-CO2 is not to promote GCS but to inform the public about
it with facts and data, hoping that this help society to be more aware and develop a critical
thinking on the intense flux of often unchecked information that is exposed to.
