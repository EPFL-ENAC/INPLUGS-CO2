INPLUGS-CO2 aims to contribute to raising awareness on the topic of geological CO2 storage, its
risks and urgency.
It targets two maing groups:
- general public: those wishing to understand how GCS works, why the technology is interesting
and potentially needed to reduce carbon emissions, and what are the risks and their mitigation.
- scientists/engineers: experts from academia and industry who are looking for high quality open
source data on GCS. This part of the website (starting early 2026) is desinged around a novel
metre-scale testbed in EPFL and can serve as a database for other GCS projects at pilot and
demonstration scales.
Main principles, key findings and live results will be actively shared with the broader public in
order to promote safe implementation of CO2 storage at larger scales.
