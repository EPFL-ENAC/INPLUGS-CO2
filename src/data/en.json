      "title": "Why Geological Carbon Storage ?",
      "subtitle_1": "Mitigating Climate Change",
      "text_1": "Carbon dioxyde (CO₂) is a transparent gas that naturally exists in the atmosphere as a trace, but its concentration has nearly doubled since its pre-industrial levels: from 0.028%, it has risen to 0.043%. This concentration increase is mainly due to human activity, predominantly related to burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas). Because CO₂ is a greenhouse gas, i.e. it traps heat, increased CO₂ emissions are directly related and correlated to the earth’s verified temperature increase. Temperature increase (or global warming) is directly associated to the occurring climate change that has an increasingly large impact on the environment and weather extremes, as well as, on human societies and ecosystems. To mitigate global warming, and consequently climate change, the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere must stop rising and net-zero emissions must be achieved.",
      "subtitle_2": "Supports Net-Zero Goals",
      "text_2": "Net-zero emissions (NZE) of CO₂ are reached when carbon dioxyde emissions due to human activities are removed from the atmosphere and durably stored in geological, ocean or terrestrial reservoirs, or in products. To achieve NZE while maintaining the increasing energy demands, progress on clean energy transition (e.g. renewable energy) is necessary but not enough for now. Decarbonisation of hard-to-abate industry (e.g. cement) and power generation (e.g. gas power plants) sectors must be reached. To date, the only possible technology that offers CO₂ removal at relevant scales for reaching net-zero by 2050, i.e. 1 gigaton (Gt) of CO₂ per year, is geological storage of captured CO₂ because on the one hand, the required storage volumes are at geological scales (very large) and, on the other hand, CO₂ is injected and stored in the subsurface at high concentrations.",
      "subtitle_3": "Large Storage Capacity",
      "text_3": "Geological CO₂ storage (GCS) or carbon sequestration is the process of injecting and storing captured CO₂ in the earth’s subsurface. It is the final part of the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) chain for reducing human-caused CO₂ in the atmosphere. GCS usually refers to durable subsurface storage of CO₂ that is captured directly from point sources (e.g. cement factories) before being released in the atmosphere, but can also apply to CO₂ from direct air capture (DAC). In GCS, CO₂ is compressed before injected at pressures similar to the pressure that exists in the subsurface at the depth of the injection. Compressed CO₂ is denser and therefore, we can store more CO₂ mass at a given subsurface volume. Over a certain depth (700-800 m), i.e. over a certain pressure level (73 bar), CO₂ changes from gas to liquid and its density becomes 25 times higher than that in the atmosphere.This means that in depths over 700-800 m, we can store 25 times more CO₂.",
      "subtitle_4": "Long-Term Storage",
      "text_4": "Durable CO₂ storage in deep geological formations (like depleted oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifers) uses the means that nature used to maintain underground oil and gas over millions of years. CO₂ is injected in a porous reservoir that is overlayed by a nearly impermeable geological layer (called caprock) that stops CO₂2 leaking to the surface.",
      "subtitle_5": "History and current status",
      "text_5": "The GCS technology was initially developped by the petrolean industry 50 years ago for enhancing  oil recovery by injecting captured CO₂ into the subsurface to push the remaining crude oil to the surface. Until today, around 80% of the CO₂ captured annually is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), this is why there is an urgent need to shift away from CO2-EOR for a achieving net-zero emissions. This urgency is considered in the planned storage agenda as of 2030, that announces 80% of its storage capacity dedicated to durable storage. This monumental shift from CO2-EOR towards dedicated CO₂ storage in the near future signals strengthened action towards net zero commitments."

        "question": "Is geological carbon storage safe?",

      "q3": {
        "question": "Why do we need to cut CO₂ emissions if CO₂ is only 0.043% of the atmosphere?",
        "answer": "CO₂ is a trace of the atmosphere's composition and its concentration has doubled since the industrial revolution. Even though the absolute number (0.043 %) is small, in relative terms, i.e. compared to its natural concentration in pre-industrial times (0.028 %) is very high. This high concentration increase is strictly related to human activity."

      "q4": {
        "question": "How much CO₂ do we need to remove to achieve net zero emissions?",
        "answer": "To achieve net zero emissions we need to capture and store 1 Gt (1 billion tons) of CO₂ per year. Current CO₂ capture and storage capacity in the world is 50 Mt (million tons) of CO₂ per year."

      "q6": {
        "question": "How does GCS work?",
        "answer": "GCS imitates the way that nature has been storing oil and gas underground over million of years.Captured CO2 is compressed, transported and injectied into a deep underground porous rock formation (called reservoir). The reservoir formation must have on top of it a nearly impermeable rock formation (called caprock) to prevent CO2 leakage to the surface and ensure durable storage."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Where can we store CO2?",
        "answer": "Geological CO2 storage sites include depleted oil and gas reservoirs, unminable coal systems and deep saline aquifers. These geological systems usually provide the necessary caprock-reservoir configuration that is needed for durable storage."

Our efforts aim to provide a solid foundation on how GCS works so that readers can form an objective opinion on the subject.
